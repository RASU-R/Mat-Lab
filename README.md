# Image Quality Metric to measure the quality of images:

Image Quality Assessment (IQA) in a digital image processing system is a very 
tough and complex task, but it is also a crucial one. In an image when a distortion 
takes place the IQA technique is required to find the quality of the distorted 
image. In this project, we have discussed some of the widely used IQA 
techniques, belonging to subjective fidelity, which corresponds to the human 
visual system (HVS), such as Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and objective 
fidelity, which corresponds to Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error 
(MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), 
and Normalised Absolute Error (NAE). Anyhow, each of these measurements has 
its limitations. This project's goal is to evaluate every picture quality metric 
already in use and create a new metric to access image quality.
